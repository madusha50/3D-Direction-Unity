# 3D-Directions
Where I will be creating my 3d direction augmented reality application. 
The application will be using Augmented Reality and 3d cameras to make a 3D directions app that will allow the end user to have accuracte directions using the camera on your phone that are overlayed onto the screen creating an easy way to travel in places that don't show up in google maps and should act as a replacement for the google streets' see inside mode for buildings. 

EX1: A university campus map; This would help you navigate to your next class allowing new students to find the facilities they need with minimal effort. 
EX2: A mall map; This would be able to easily figure out where specific stores are without the need to manually look for the store and how to get there on the mall maps or google maps. An Advanced feature of this would be showing the stores with specific brands and which one is closer to you. 
EX3: A convention or event map; This would allow for the convention or event to preprogram specific stations or places that can be overlayed onto a preexisting map of a building and easily create maps for people to use to navigate.

Tentative 3D mapping solution
- Iphone Camera(polycam pro) export to obj and work in unity
- Matterport camera + application

Programs 
-Unity 3D
-Visual Studio Code
